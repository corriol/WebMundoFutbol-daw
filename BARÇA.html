                <h2>The perfect season of the 'Pep Team': 10 years of the Sextete are celebrated</h2>
                <p>
                    On December 19, 2009, the machine created by Pep Guardiola achieved a miracle in the football world after signing a perfect year: in the same year they won the Copa del Rey, the League, the Champions League, the Spanish Super Cup, the Europe and the Club World Cup. The famous Sextete that left the Spanish coach crying on the pitch after a goal from Messi with his heart. Six titles and a unique way of playing to reach football heaven.
                    Barcelona laid the first stone of the Sextete on May 13, 2009 after defeating Athletic (1-4) in the final of the Copa del Rey that took place in Mestalla.
                    Guardiola's team sang the alirón in Mallorca without playing on May 16, 2009, after Real Madrid lost at Villarreal. The coach took advantage of the white 'gift' to reserve some of his players for the Champions League final that awaited him ten days
                    after.
                    Pep's Barcelona defeated Manchester United (2-0) in an exhibition of Messi and the entire Barça team to lift the Champions League on May 27, 2009. The Argentine star's gliding at the Olympic in Rome will always be remembered for lovers of good football. Barça became the first Spanish team to achieve the treble and the fifth in Europe.
                    A goal from De Marcos in the 44th minute of the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup - added to 10 minutes from pájara - put the fourth title of the 'Pep Team' in trouble. However, it was all a mirage. Xavi and Pedro turned the score around after the break (1-2) at San Mamés. The return to Camp Noun had no history and Barcelona took the match on the fast track (3-0).
                    On August 28, 2009, Barcelona won their fifth title after defeating Shakhtar Donetsk (1-0) with a goal from Pedro in extra time.
                    On December 19, 2009, Leo Messi scored with his heart the goal that completed Pep Guardiola's masterpiece to defeat Estudiantes de La Plata (1-2) in Abu Dhabi.

                <h2>Guardiola's triplet</h2>
                Perhaps Guardiola's triplet is the closest to what Ernesto Valverde could experience. The calendar has meant that the famous song of the triplet of the program 'Crackòvia' can be repeated a few years later. Despite being 6 points ahead of Real Madrid in the 2008/2009 League standings, Guardiola's first title was the Copa del Rey. It was awarded after beating Athletic 1-4.
                        
                        This title would later be followed by the achievement of the League. It was on matchday 36 of the championship, two before the end of the League. a success that ended up closing with the third title of the season: the Champions League.
                        
                        On May 27, 2009, Barcelona won the Champions League final against Manchester United 2-0 and thus signed a round season. In the quarterfinals he had eliminated Bayern Munich, while in the semifinals he had gotten rid of Chelsea.
                        
                        A campaign that closed with the last league game in which Barcelona tied with Deportivo and closed the standings with a total of 87 points, against 78 for Real Madrid, the second classified.

                <h3> Trophies of the triplete Guardiola</h3>
                <h2>Luis Enrique's triplet</h2>
                The story of Pep Guardiola was repeated a few years later with Luis Enrique on the bench. On this occasion, it cost much more to win all three titles, despite the fact that many of the rivals were the same. Luis Enrique also achieved a treble in his first season, specifically in the 2014/2015 campaign.
                        
                        On this occasion, the first title was the league. He did it after beating Atlético de Madrid on the penultimate round of the championship. In that season, Barcelona's difference with its immediate pursuer was only four points. Barcelona had 71 points on matchday 29, to 67 for Real Madrid. The championship ended with 94 points for the Blaugrana and 92 for Real Madrid.
                        
                        The League was succeeded this time by the title of champion of the Copa del Rey. Again the other finalist was Athletic Club, which ended up losing 1-3.
    
                        The same result was repeated in the Champions League final, which was the competition that closed the season. Juventus fell 1-3 to Barcelona in the final in Berlin. Before, in the quarterfinals they had been charged with PSG, while in the semifinals it was Bayern Munich who were eliminated.
