                <h2>The historical classification of LaLiga: the battle to be the best of all time</h2>
                <p>
                    Within this list are all the teams that have ever played in the First Division. From the first competitors back in February 1929 to the latest incorporations. None are missing.

                    63 clubs that are forever immortalized in the noble zone of national football. Only nine of these teams have managed to win the championship and only three have been present in the 90 seasons that the competition has been played and have never been relegated to the Second Division.
                    First division champions
                    Athletic Club, Barça and Real Madrid accumulate 2,896 games played on their long backs. The white team is the leader with 92 points of advantage over Barça. Curiously, the Catalans dominate in the section of goals in favor (6216 against 6110) despite having eight leagues less than their rival from Madrid.
                    
                    Atlético de Madrid appears in third place at a sidereal distance from the two giants of Spanish football. However, the evolution of the rojiblancos in recent seasons has been meteoric until they have settled on the historic podium. He started the 2011/12 season in fifth place behind Valencia and Athletic, but the arrival of Cholo Simeone to the bench caused the double 'sorpasso'.
                    Seasons in First
                    Sevilla is the other club that is soaring in this classification, but it still follows a world of its predecessors because of the difference in matches played in the highest category of Spanish football. Of course, the difference with Betis (tenth) is huge.
                    Some teams like Villarreal have clearly benefited from the move to the three-point league. Until 1995/96, two points were awarded for a victory and not the current three. That is why the yellow team (21st place) or Getafe (23rd) appear in such high positions with very few seasons in the First League compared to other powerful teams that have fallen short in the last years of the 20th century such as Zaragoza, Sporting or Oviedo.

                    In addition, in the 'top 20' of this historical classification, the impressive current level of LaLiga Smartbank stands out. Almost half of the teams (eight in total) currently play in Segunda or Segunda B (Deportivo de la Coruña and Racing de Santander).
